__This README documents necessary steps to get the application up and running.__

**Version 1.1.0**

# Description
*The repository contains projects for Data Representation module.*
This project demonstrates that a student understands creating and consuming RESTful API. 

The application is designed for the Martingrove Tennis Club in Toronto and gather new Members for 2023 season. Soon, the application will be integrated with WIX and published online at the: https://www.martingrovetennis.com/ 

# Particular project`s description
In this project I created a Web application in Flask that has a RESTful API. The application is linked to one database table.
The application does CRUD operations: create, read, update and delete.
Specifically, the following methods have been included:
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

To see current Members:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/members

To create new Members (for example):
http://127.0.0.1:5000/members?full_name=test&ranking=1&gta_city=Torotno

To delete a Member (for example):
http://127.0.0.1:5000/members?full_name=test
The message will appear: "The details have been deleted properly. Please update the table if necessary"

The application has been tested with e Postman API Platform (as well with the Postman on the web). = https://www.postman.com/downloads/
